# List of Components
This list details all of the components used in the making of the bot. Note this list is in constant development and as a result is incomplete, so quantities and specs may change over time.
## Servos and/or Motors
1. **SG90 Servo (x2)**
   - For a FreeCAD 3d model see the "Component - SG90 Servo.FCStd" file
   - Note SG90 dimensions can vary by a few millimeters from make to make, so please check your dimensions before using this model
## Standard Components
1. **Bearing - 6mm x 10mm x 3mm (x2)**
   - For a FreeCAD 3d model see the "Component - 6mm x 10mm x 3mm.FCStd" file
## 3D Printed Parts
### Arm Assembly
1. **Shoulder Servo Rotational Cog 16 teeth v2 (x2)**
   - See the FreeCad 3d model "Shoulder Servo Rotational Cog 16 teeth v2.FCStd"
   - This cog attaches to the servo that rotates the arm between downward and upward positions.
   - 16 Teeth with a module of 1.38.
   - Will be matched with a cog attached to the arm
2. **Shoulder Cog and Inner Pivot (x2)**
   - See the FreeCad 3d model "Shoulder Cog and Inner Pivot.FCStd"
   - This cog is on the inside of the arm mechanism and provides a part of the pivot the arm rotates on.
   - Pairs with *Outer Shoulder and Pivot*
3. **Shoulder Pivot Outer (x2)**
   - See the FreeCad 3d model "Shoulder Pivot Outer.FCStd"
   - This is the outer pivot element of the shoulder pivot
   - Pairs with *Shoulder Gear and Pivot*
4. **Flapper Lever (x2)**
   - See the FreeCad 3d model "Flapper lever.FCStd"   
   - Converts rotational servo movement into a push / pull motion via the flapper bar and stoppers
5. **Flapper Bar (x2)**
   - See the FreeCad 3d model "flapper Bar.FCStd"
   - Transfers the movement from the servo to the flapping pivot point in the shoulder
6. **Flapper Bar Stopper (x4)**
   - See the FreeCad 3d model "Flapper Bar Stopper.FCStd"
   - Screws onto the flapper bar so the flapper lever can push on the flapper bar
