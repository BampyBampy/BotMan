This is just a raw dumping ground for bits and pieces I found useful. There is zero logic to the layout of this page
## Calculate the distance between 2 cogs
In this example, we have two cogs, one with 16 teeth and one with 14 teeth with a module of 1.38. The formula is

Distance = (Module x (Teeth 1 + Teeth 2)) / 2
=(1.38 x (16 + 14)) / 2
= 20.7mm

Shoulder cogs will be 15mm horizontally apart and 14.26mm vertically apart
