# Diary of a Gen-X robot builder
This is only provided to give you some clues to the decisions made during the development of the project. i.e. so you can learn from my mistakes.
### 23rd July 2023
In the middle of the night, I realised my first design for the arm assembly was massively flawed. If the arm rotated so it was pointing up or down, the lever to push/pull the flapping mechanism would disengage. So that was redesigned today and now looks more like the mechanism in the original bot I'm using as a template for this project.

I also realised that having the drive cogs offset vertically and horizontally was unnecessary and would result in lots of unnecessary maths. So in this version, one cog is directly above the other with no horizontal offset. This should make mounting the servos much easier.

The next stage is to design some arms and to 3d print everything so I can test everything works. For the time being the arms will be a simple bar - I won't design the cosmetic elements until the very end of the project.
